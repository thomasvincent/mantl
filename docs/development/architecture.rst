Architecture and Design Patterns
===========================

This document provides an overview of Mantl's architecture and the key design patterns used throughout the project.

System Architecture
------------------

Mantl is composed of several key components that work together to provide a complete platform for deploying distributed services:

Node Types
^^^^^^^^^^

Mantl uses three primary node types:

1. **Control Nodes**: Run cluster management services like Consul, Mesos masters, ZooKeeper, and Kubernetes control plane components.
   
2. **Agent Nodes**: Run containers and other workloads, including Mesos agents and Kubernetes nodes.
   
3. **Edge Nodes**: Handle external traffic routing into the cluster, using proxies like Traefik.

Core Components
--------------

Consul
^^^^^^

Consul provides service discovery and distributed key-value storage. In Mantl, Consul forms the foundation for several key capabilities:

* Service discovery for all components
* Health checking and monitoring
* Distributed configuration storage
* Cluster membership and failure detection

Mesos and Marathon
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Apache Mesos provides resource abstraction and allocation across the cluster:

* Mesos manages resources (CPU, memory, etc.) across the cluster
* Marathon provides container orchestration and application lifecycle management
* Together they enable scheduling and failover of containerized applications

Kubernetes
^^^^^^^^^

Kubernetes provides container orchestration with:

* Pod-based deployment model
* Self-healing capabilities
* Rich scheduling options
* Service discovery and load balancing

Vault
^^^^^

Vault provides secure secrets management:

* Central secrets storage
* Secure credential distribution
* Dynamic secret generation
* Fine-grained access control

Traefik
^^^^^^^

Traefik provides dynamic service routing:

* Automatic service discovery via Consul
* Dynamic reconfiguration
* HTTP and HTTPS support
* Load balancing

Design Patterns
--------------

Service Discovery Pattern
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Services in Mantl register themselves with Consul and discover dependencies through Consul's DNS or HTTP API. This provides:

* Dynamic discovery of services
* Automatic failover
* Location transparency for services

Configuration as Code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Mantl follows the principle of infrastructure as code:

* Terraform for provisioning infrastructure
* Ansible for configuration management
* Declarative definitions for all components
* Version-controlled configurations

High Availability Pattern
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Critical services in Mantl are deployed in a high-availability configuration:

* Multiple control nodes
* Distributed consensus protocols (Raft, Paxos)
* Automatic failover
* No single points of failure

Security by Default
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Mantl implements security by default:

* TLS encryption for service communication
* Authentication and authorization for all services
* Vault for secrets management
* Least privilege principle

Monitoring and Observability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Mantl includes comprehensive monitoring:

* Metrics collection with collectd
* Centralized logging with ELK stack
* Health checking via Consul
* Distributed tracing

Data Flow and Communication
--------------------------

Service Registration and Discovery
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Services register with Consul on startup
2. Services discover dependencies via Consul DNS or API
3. Consul provides health checking for services

External Traffic Flow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. External requests hit edge nodes
2. Traefik routes requests to appropriate services
3. Services respond directly or via other services

Container Deployment Flow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. User submits application to Marathon or Kubernetes
2. Scheduler selects appropriate agent nodes
3. Container is deployed on agent nodes
4. Service is registered in Consul
5. Service becomes available via service discovery

Implementation Considerations
----------------------------

State Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Critical state stored in distributed systems (ZooKeeper, etcd, Consul)
* Application state managed by specialized stateful services
* Use of persistent volumes for stateful workloads

Scalability
^^^^^^^^^^

* Horizontal scaling of all components
* Independent scaling of control, agent, and edge nodes
* Resource-aware scheduling

Failure Handling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Automated recovery from node failures
* Service health monitoring and self-healing
* Distributed consensus for leader election

Future Architecture Directions
-----------------------------

1. **Enhanced Multi-Cloud Support**: Improved management across multiple cloud providers
2. **Serverless Capabilities**: Integration with Function-as-a-Service frameworks
3. **Advanced Networking**: Software-defined networking enhancements
4. **Advanced Observability**: Distributed tracing and enhanced monitoring
