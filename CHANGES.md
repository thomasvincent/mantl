   - Added pre-commit hooks

## Next Steps

1. **Documentation**
   - Continue improving component documentation
   - Add more examples and tutorials
   - Keep documentation in sync with code changes

2. **Code Quality**
   - Apply linting rules to existing codebase (many linting issues were identified)
   - Fix code style issues gradually, focusing on most critical first
   - Increase test coverage
   - Modernize dependencies

3. **Automation**
   - Enhance CI/CD pipeline
   - Automate documentation building
   - Add release automation

> **Note**: The initial linting check has identified numerous code style issues in the existing codebase. These should be addressed systematically over time, focusing on the most critical files first. The pre-commit hooks will ensure that new contributions follow the established style guidelines.
